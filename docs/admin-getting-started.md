## Admin Panel

After successful Hubs deployment, navigate to your hub's hosted domain name (e.g. `myhub.com` or `hub.mydomain.com`). 

In the upper right corner, click "Sign In" and enter the email address you set as `ADM_EMAIL` in `input-values.yaml`.
In your email inbox, click the received "magic link" to login.

Once you've logged into Hubs Community Edition for the first time, you should see the Hubs Admin Console.
It should look like this:

![Administration Admin Landing](img/admin-landing.png)

If so, congratulations! You've successfully deployed your own personal Social VR hub, powered by Hubs by Hubs Foundation.

You can always get back to the Admin Console by navigating to your site and looking for the "Admin" link in the top navigation bar:

## Creating a room

Now that your site is up and running, you can create a room by clicking on the "Create a Room" link from the homepage:

![Administration Create Room](img/homepage-create-room.jpeg)

The first thing you'll notice... is your room is totally empty! Community Edition isn't very useful until you [import some scenes and avatars](./admin-importing-content).

## Setting up your hub

Here's some things you can do to continue setting up your hub:

- [Import content](./admin-importing-content) so your visitors will have access to a library of scenes and avatars.
- [Enable the Scene Editor](./admin-enable-scene-editor) to let visitors create their own scenes.
- [Enable permissive rooms](./admin-permissive-rooms) to let visitors add media to their rooms.
- [Learn how to manage content](./admin-managing-content) so visitors can contribute content to your hub.
- [Add Administrators](./admin-adding-administrators) if you'd like others to help you set up your hub.
