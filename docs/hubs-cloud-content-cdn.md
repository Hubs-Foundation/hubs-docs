If you are using a provider which meters bandwidth like AWS, you can greatly reduce data transfer costs by using Cloudflare's CDN. If you are running on a single server like DigitalOcean, using Cloudflare's CDN will also reduce latency when users download assets from your hub.

To do so, in the [Admin Console](./admin-getting-started) choose **Content CDN** and follow the instructions.
