## Change the Scene

There are lots of scenes to choose from in our featured scenes browser. You can also upload your own using our scene editor, [Spoke](./intro-spoke.html). If you are a room moderator, find the scene browser by opening the dropdown menu and selecting "Choose a Scene". 

Note that only featured scenes have been tested for performance across devices. For more information on how featured scenes are selected take a look at our [Featured Content Guidelines](./creators-content-guidelines.html).

## Change Room Name

To change the name of a room, room moderators can select "Room Settings" from the dropdown menu and enter a new name.

## Room Access


## Room Permissions

By default, rooms are set to "Shared link" mode, where room links contain unique, random identifiers. Sharing this link will give anyone access to the room. You can also set the room to "Invite only" mode, which allows you to generate a link with an additional unique, random identifier. Visitors must then use this invite link to access the room, and the invite link can be revoked to deny future access to the room. When an invite link is revoked, a new one is generated in its place. Users who are already in the room will not be removed from it.

Note: You can also switch from "Invite only" mode back to "Shared link" mode. Since "Shared link" mode is less restrictive, it will allow users with previously revoked invite links to access the room. If you want to prevent this, keep the room in "Invite only" mode.


You can specify whether users in the room are able to create and move objects, create cameras, pin content, draw with the pen, create emojii, and fly. By default, all these features are enabled. To toggle them select "Room Settings" from the dropdown menu and set the permissions you want.

## Promoting Room Moderators

When in a room with other trusted users, the room owner can promote other users to also have moderation permissions. Promoted moderators have all of the same permissions as a room owner. It is important to ensure that users who are promoted to moderator are trusted parties, as they will have abilities to rename, change scenes, and close the room.

To promote a user to moderator, select the user from the user list and click the "Promote" button. Users need to be signed in to be promoted.

## Maximum Capacity

Hubs rooms have a maximum capacity of 25 people in-room to ensure performance across devices. However, many more can watch from the lobby, even when the room is full.

Users in the lobby can see and hear what's going on inside the room, and can interact with others through chat. If a room is full, we recommend turning on "Camera Mode" to broadcast a moderator's view to the lobby. 

## Camera Mode

Camera mode broadcasts a moderator's view to the lobby. This allows users who haven't entered the room to see what's going on in the virtual space from the moderator's point of view. To turn on "Camera Mode" select it from the dropdown menu.

Entering camera mode also reveals a button to hide the user interface. This can be helpful when doing screen recordings of an event. Press Esc to show the user interface again.

## Kick Users

To temporarily kick a user from the room, open the avatar menu and select "Kick." 

## Discord Authentication 

When you create a room in Hubs, it is private by default. Sharing the link or access code with other people allows them to enter that specific room, so generally, you want to be careful with who has the link.  

You can link a Hubs room to a channel in a Discord server and have your server members join with their Discord accounts. Banning a user from your server or removing them from the Discord channel will prevent them from being able to re-join the linked Hubs room, even if that user still has the link to the room. You can learn more about the Hubs Discord bot [here](./hubs-discord-bot.html). 

## Favorite Rooms

Add a room to your list of favorites by opening up the 'More' menu and clicking 'Favorite Room'. Adding a room to your favorites makes it easier to find again by adding it to your home Hubs screen.

To remove the room from your favorites, open the room, open the 'More' menu, and click 'Unfavorite Room'. 

## Close a Room

When you leave a Hubs room, it remains accessible via its URL. You can choose to permanently close the room by selecting "Close Room" from the dropdown menu. Links and codes for the room will no longer work for anyone, including the room owner.
