## Changing Name and Avatar

The first time you enter a Hubs room you will choose a name and an avatar. You can change them at any time by clicking the 'People' menu in the top left corner of the screen and selecting your own name from the list.

Use one of our featured avatars or [upload your own](intro-avatars.html).

### My Avatars

For quick access to your favorite avatars, you can save them to "My Avatars" for quick access. Press the "Copy to my Avatars" icon associated with the avatar in the avatar selection screen.

Advanced user preferences (e.g., media volume, movement controls, graphics resolution, etc), can be found in the user preferences section of the dropdown menu.
