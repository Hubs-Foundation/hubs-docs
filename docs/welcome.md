Hubs is a unique way to bring people and communities together in a shared virtual space. Designed to simulate real life, you can gather in a variety of locations such as at the beach, in a conference room, or at an outdoor festival.

All you need is a computer with a web browser and an internet connection. Got a virtual reality (VR) headset? Awesome! You can use that too.


### What You Can Do
Host a conference, teach a class, showcase art, walk around in ancient ruins, have movie night, or enjoy hanging out with friends as just a few examples.

### Create Your Online World
You can create your own space with just a few steps. Setup your room by importing images, videos, 3D models, and more. 

Once your space is created you can invite others to join by giving them a URL or a room code.

Interactions mimic real life as well. You can find someone from across the room. Engage in conversations with everyone together or break out into smaller groups. If someone is being rowdy ask them to leave or simply kick them out.

### Customize Avatars and Scenes
Hubs is open source and customizable, giving you the freedom to express who you are and choose where you want to be.

### Cloud Hosting
You can transfer Hubs onto a private server by using AWS or DigitalOcean. This will give you more control such as adding custom branding, using your own domain name, limit access to approved users, and building your own featues and functionality.
