**Important Notice:** A significant portion of this documentation contains outdated information.  There are ongoing efforts to update it. Chiefly, Hubs by Mozilla and Hubs Cloud are obsolete.  Hubs Community Edition has the same user experience.  Got questions?  Our community Discord is standing by.  https://discord.gg/hubs-498741086295031808

Hubs is a virtual collaboration platform that runs in your browser. With Hubs you can create your own 3D spaces with a single click. Invite others to join using a URL. No installation or app store required.

## Who is Hubs for?

Hubs is for anyone who wants to connect with others remotely! It's a great way to bring communities together in a shared virtual space.

Host a conference, teach a class, showcase art, or just hang out with friends. Hubs makes it easy to connect and share images, videos, 3D models, and more. With Hubs' spatialized audio you can have conversations with everyone together or break out into smaller groups &mdash; just like you can in person.

Hubs works across platforms. Got a VR headset? Awesome! If not, you can use your desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or mobile devices to explore in 2D ([see supported browsers](hubs-create-join-rooms.html#for-2d-experience)).

## Customizing Hubs

Hubs is open source and customizable. Upload [personalized avatars](intro-avatars.html) or create unique environments using [Spoke](intro-spoke.html).

Want more control over your Hubs interface? You can self-host your own version of the platform using [Community Edition](admin-intro.html). Add custom branding, use your own domain name, limit access to approved users, and build your own features and functionality.

### What is Spoke?

[Spoke](intro-spoke.html) is the built-in scene editor for creating environments that can be used in Hubs rooms. The editor runs entirely in the browser and allows you to upload your own 3D models, images, and files to use in your projects. Spoke also contains building kits and integrations with content providers to help you build the perfect space!
