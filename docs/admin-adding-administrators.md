## Powers

Administrators for your hub have full access rights. They can:

- Have access to the [Admin Console](./admin-getting-started) to update system settings and app configuration.
- [Manage the content library](./admin-managing-content) and [import content](./admin-importing-content).
- Have access to the [Scene Editor](./spoke-creating-projects.md) to create and publish new scenes, regardless of settings.

## Granting Admin Access

Community Edition does not store any personally identifying information in the database.
To promote a user to administrator, first get from them the email address they use with your Hubs instance.

Navigate to the **Accounts** section in the Admin Console:

![Administration Accounts](img/hubs-cloud-accounts.jpeg)

From there, enter their email address under **Find an account with an email address** and then click Find.

![Administration Find Account](img/admin-find-account-email.png)

Then set the account to **Is admin** and click **Save**:

![Administration Select Admin](img/hubs-cloud-select-admin.jpeg)
