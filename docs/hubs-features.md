1. __Volume:__ Changes the volume of the user's audio. (Doesn't affect the volume for others in the room.)

Note that video recordings are temporarily saved to browser storage; a recording in progress may be lost if the browser runs out  of space.

## Emoji Spawners

A menu of emoji spawners is displayed when you display [object or avatar menus](./hubs-features.html#menus).

![Hubs - Emoji Spawners Menu](img/hubs-emoji-spawners.jpeg)

The emoji menu lets you spawn a grabbable emoji that emits particles when shaken. The emoji is deleted a few seconds after you let go of it.


## Invite Menu

The "Invite" button opens a dialog with the information you need in order to share the room with others, so they can join you in the room.

![Hubs - Invite Menu](img/hubs-invite-dialogue.PNG)

You can copy or share the hub.link URL or use the numeric code to share a link verbally. Note that numeric codes expire after 72 hours.

The `iframe` HTML code (displayed if you have room permissions) lets you embed the room in a web page.

<!-- The "notify me" checkbox (displayed if you have room permissions) enables you to sign up for notifications that alert you when another user enters the room. You can sign up for notifications on your phone or desktop. You do not need to remain in the room to receive notifications. -->
