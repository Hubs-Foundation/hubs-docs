title: Beginner‚Äôs Guide to CE
description: A detailed guide on how to set up a Hubs Community Edition instance.
---

These instructions are written for users, newbies, or non-developers. This Hubs Community Edition installation uses Scaleway for an email service, Porkbun for a web domain, and DigitalOcean (DO) for hosting. If you vary from this path, your mileage may vary (YMMV).

## **Preparation**

### Before you start, you need:

* **An email address** that you can reliably access. We‚Äôll refer to this as your admin email in these instructions.
* Safe **password storage.**
* A **Windows** computer. (Anyone using a Mac or Linux system should be able to follow this and just make adjustments.)
* Confidence to use a **command line interface or terminal**. These are step by step instructions. We‚Äôll walk you through this.

### What you will get:

This Hubs build at DO supports 30-60 maximum concurrent users. Of course, heavy concurrent use *can* lower that number. YMMV

The cost is US$36 per month minimum, plus ~US$1 annual for the first year domain (August 2024 prices).

Scaleway provides you magic link log-in emails (SMTP), and Porkbun provides a web domain with DNS service.

You will be the captain of your own Hubs. You have control and privacy.

Note: images in this set of instructions have some lines blurred where there is personally identifiable information.

### What will you do?

1. Download stuff and open accounts: Steps 1 through 9
2. Connect to DigitalOcean: Steps 10 through 11
3. Upload your Hubs: Steps 12 through 15
4. Kick the tires and light the fires: Step 16

### How long will this take?

We estimate that proficient users might get this done in 45 minutes to 2 hours. It might take several days if you proceed very carefully and slowly. Parts of these instructions do take time on servers. Patience is necessary.

### How much will this cost?

We estimate US$1 per year for the first year of a domain and US$36 per month minimum. Your email SMTP service might be free or might cost a small amount of money (US$1-$5 per month). It might be safe to estimate US$40 per month.

b. Under Products, select **Domains**.

![Capture of Porkbun, Products menu with Domains as first choice down from the top, highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image23.png)

c. Search for a domain name if you already have a specific name in mind or you may shop by reviewing for different ending web domain extensions (the .com or .net or .xyz part of a web address) and their prices.

![Capture of Porkbun, Search for your new domain name search box in the top center of the page highlighted in  purple. Alternative text "Or scroll down" points to extensions available to select before searching for an entire domain name.](img/beginnersguide/image24.png)

Select column headers ‚ÄúRegistration‚Äù, ‚ÄúRenewal‚Äù, or ‚ÄúTransfer‚Äù to sort by lowest price in each column.

![Capture of Porkbun, sorting of extensions by initial registration cost, ordering cheapest initial costs are top choices. For example, dot space or dot website were $1.11 in this capture.](img/beginnersguide/image25.png)

For example, let‚Äôs say you select the **.space** (dot space) extension because it is currently on a 1st Year Sale of US$1.11.
> ü§î Advice: Pay special attention to the Renewal column, however, because that is what you will be charged every year after.

Next, search if your full domain name is available to buy. Let‚Äôs say you want ‚Äúmycoolhubs.space‚Äù, **enter mycoolhubs in the search box** and **select the magnifying glass** (submit search).

Note from the future: Scaleway ONLY wants domains that meet these conditions, so follow them now: The domain can only contain alphanumeric characters, dots, and dashes.

![Capture of Porkbun, search for full domain name box in center of page. This is where both parts of a domain name are checked to see if they are available.

d. For Choose cluster capacity, Select a scaling type, select **Fixed** or **Autoscale**.
> ü§î Advice: Fixed will help control your costs, but Autoscale will make sure that the servers are up if and when you need them. You decide: Fixed = cheaper but slightly less reliable, Autoscale = more expensive but more reliable. We are selecting Fixed in these instructions.

Note: You may ignore this warning:  You have reached the 3 Droplet on your account. Request increase.

e. For Node pool name: **Change the name** to something that makes sense to you.
> ü§î Advice: hcce-cluster-yoursetupreason-date

f. For Machine Type:  Leave selected as **Basic, Regular SSD**

g. For Node plan: Select **$24/month per node** ($0.036/hour) of 4GB total RAM / 2 vCPUs / 80 GB storage (June 2024 specifications) Tip üí°Hubs Community Edition needs 3-3.5 GB RAM to run. Choosing 4 GB RAM gets you *the minimum you need*.  If you run into too many problems, re-think this choice.

> üí° Tip: DigitalOcean charges an extra $12/month for mandatory load balancing.<br>
So a $24 choice here will be $24 + $12 a month for a total of $36 a month.

h. For Nodes: Select **the negative sign to reduce this from 3 to 1**.

> ü§î Advice:  One node is enough. **Warning:** if you increase the nodes to 2 or more, you will need to [set up external storage](https://hominidsoftware.com/tech-personal-growth/Hubs-on-DigitalOcean/) to prevent data loss.

Note: This warning should have changed to: You are near the 3 Droplet limit on your account. Request increase. You can continue to ignore this warning.

## **Section 2 Connect DO**

### 10. Generate DO API token

You need to get a ‚Äòpassword‚Äô in the form of an API Token from DO so that your modified Hubs code can be accepted by DO. You‚Äôll insert that token into doctl so that DigitalOcean can understand it.

a. Go to [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).  From the same sidebar where MANAGE is, go to the 4th menu section that has Billing, Support, Settings, API. Select **API**.

> üí° Tip: We found that you can API via your Tab button.


![Capture of DigitalOcean left menu. API New button under Billing, Support, and Settings is highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image61.png)

b. Select **Generate New Token**.

![Capture of DigitalOcean, Applications & API page. "Generate New Token" blue button in center lower right of page highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image62.png)

c. Token Name:  This can be any text. The name will appear with dashes. For example: My-First-Token.

d. Expiration: Select **no expire**.

e. Scopes: Select **Full Access**.

f. Select **Generate Token**.

![Capture of DigitalOcean, Create A New Personal Access Token page. Field for Token Name highlighted in purple. Expiration menu choice "No expire" highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image63.png)

![Capture of DigitalOcean, Create A New Personal Access Token page, continued. For Scopes, Full Access and "Generate Token" green button are highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image64.png)

g. **Copy and save** your Token somewhere securely. If you ever change computers to control your Hubs, you‚Äôll either need this Token or you‚Äôll need to [generate a new Token](./faq.md#can-i-change-my-token-from-do-if-my-token-has-been-compromised).

![Capture of DigitalOcean Applications & API dashboard page. Token code is show under "Don't forget to copy your new personal access token". Copy icon is highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image65.png)

### 11. Authenticate doctl

a. Copy and paste or type **the following text** into the terminal window of VS Code, changing `<NAME>` to any generic name (e.g. MyHubsCE) and hit enter on your keyboard. No need to keep the less than or greater than symbols: `< >`

```shell
doctl auth init --context <NAME>
```

For example: `doctl auth init --context MyHubsCE`

![Capture of VS Code terminal window. Text: "doctl auth init --context (blurred)" and then "Enter your access token: *required" highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image66.png)

b. The terminal will prompt `> Enter your access token:`  **Paste in the DO API token.** Hit enter on your keyboard.

‚òëÔ∏è Green check mark means success!

![Capture of VS Code notification screen with text "Validating your token..." with a green check mark.](img/beginnersguide/image67.png)

c. Then type or paste this line, putting the name you used from Step 13a above for `<NAME>`

`doctl auth switch --context <NAME>`  *Make sure you type two dashes just before the text ‚Äòcontext‚Äô

For example `doctl auth switch --context MyHubsCE`

![Capture of VS Code text: "doctl auth switch --context (blurred)" highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image68.png)

d. Return to DO, go to your Kubernetes cluster. You‚Äôve already done step 1 so now go to step 2  called **‚ÄòConnecting to Kubernetes‚Äô**.

e. Copy the code presented in the **Automated (recommended)** tab and paste **it into your Terminal window** and **hit enter on your keyboard.**

![Capture from DigitalOcean, Getting Started with Kubernetes page. "2 Connecting to Kubernetes" at center left highlighted with purple. Copy icon in center right after "Run the command below to authenticate: doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig..." highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image69.png)

g. Skip DO‚Äôs Step 3 called Verify Connectivity, select **Continue**.

h. Skip DO‚Äôs Step 4 called Deploy a workload, select **Great, I‚Äôm done**.


![Capture from DigitalOcean, 4 Deploy a workload page. "Great, I'm done" blue button in bottom center of page highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image72.png)

## **Section 3 Upload your Hubs**

### 12. Generate your config file

Here is where you are going to change your Hubs code so that all of the accounts and parts work under your authority (passwords, tokens, etc.).

a. In VS Code, at HUBS-CLOUD-MASTER, select **community-edition**.

![Capture of VS Code, Explorer tab, HUBS-CLOUD-MASTER folder, "community-edition" on left highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image73.png)

b. Select **input-values.yaml**  We will be working lines 1-21.

![Capture of VS Code, "input values.yaml" file on left under "community-edition" highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image74.png)

c. Enter these values as described below. Warning: Only change the lines that you are instructed to change. Do not change any line that you do not know what it does. In all cases, make sure your entry is between the quote marks (‚Äú) in VS Code with no extra spaces.

<ul>

  i. For HUB_DOMAIN: your domain purchased from Porkbun

  ii. For ADM_EMAIL: Your **real, private** account.
  > ü§î Advice: This email account becomes the Admin of everything so choose the email you can reliably get into.

  ![Capture of VS Code, input-values.yaml file. Line 2: ADM_EMAIL: "admin@example.com" is highlighted with text: Click here and type your domain.](img/beginnersguide/image75.png)

  iii. For Namespace: ‚Äùhcce‚Äô‚Äù<- Leave that

  iv. For the SMTP_SERVER and the following SMTP lines, retrieve your Scaleway **Host**, **Port**, **Username**, and **Secret Key** entries that you saved from Step 6.

  <ul>

  a. Server -> SMTP_SERVER: paste in **the server** you saved from Step 6 Set up SMTP email service, Part 4, Step 1.

  b. Port -> SMTP_PORT: enter **2587**

  c. Username -> SMTP_USER: paste in the **Username** you saved from Step 6, Set up SMTP email service Part 4, Step 1

  d. Password -> SMTP_PASS: paste in the **Secret Key** you saved from Step 6 Set up SMTP email, Part 4, Step 15.
  > üí° Tip: Make sure you are using your Scaleway Username and Secret Key, not your Access Key ID.

</ul>

</ul>

d. For SKETCHFAB_API_KEY: ‚Äù?‚Äù

Get your API from your Sketchfab account. Wait, doesn‚Äôt this link your Sketchfab account to *any* use in your Hub? No, this API key allows access to Sketchfab, it doesn‚Äôt connect with any value to your personal Sketchfab account. Why are you doing this?
> ü§î Advice: Sketchfab linkage is one of the most fun aspects of Hubs. You and your users will enjoy this feature.

<ul>
<ul>

  i. Log into [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/). Select your **profile icon** in the upper right corner. Select ‚Äò**Settings**‚Äô.

  ![Capture of VS Code, input-values.yaml file. Line 2: ADM_EMAIL: "admin@example.com" is highlighted with text: Click here and type your domain.](img/beginnersguide/image76.png)

  ii. Select Password & API. Copy the Token and paste it between the quotation marks, replacing the question mark.

  ![Capture from Sketchfab, My Settings page. "Password & API" on left menu is highlighted. "API token" with token code blurred in the center is highlighted with purple.](img/beginnersguide/image77.png)

</ul>
</ul>

e. Change `NODE_COOKIE`, `GUARDIAN_KEY`, & `PHX_KEY` to unique random values, using a password generator if you have one handy.

f. For now, leave all of the other fields unchanged. Here is an example, filled in:

![Capture from VS Code, input-values.yaml file. Example of filled in values, blurred in some lines.](img/beginnersguide/image78.png)

g. In VS Code, select **File, Save**. This will keep all of the changes you just made.

![Capture from VS Code, File menu. "File" and "Save" are highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image79.png)

h. To be sure you are in your community-edition directory, **copy and paste** this into the terminal and **hit enter**:

```shell
cd community-edition
```

![Capture from VS Code, terminal window. Text "cd community-edition" highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image80.png)

i. To install all of the dependencies for the generation commands we will run, **copy and paste the following text** and **hit enter on your keyboard** (you will only need to do this once, the first time):

```shell
npm ci
```

![Capture from VS Code, terminal window. After hubs-cloud\community-edition> text: "npm ci" highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image81.png)

j. To generate your Kubernetes config file for DO, **copy and paste the following text** and **hit enter on your keyboard:**

```shell
npm run gen-hcce
```

![Capture from VS Code, terminal window. Text after community-edition, "npm run gen-hcce" highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image82.png)

### 13. Using Kubectl to deploy to DigitalOcean

Now it is time to upload your custom hcce.yaml file to DigitalOcean.

a. Now we need to apply your changes to Kubernetes on DO. **Copy and paste** this into the terminal and **hit enter on your keyboard**:

```shell
kubectl apply -f hcce.yaml
```

It will take a few seconds. Ongoing results look like this:

![Capture from VS Code, terminal window. Notification that kubernetes is applying the customized hubs file.](img/beginnersguide/image83.png)

Final result looks like this:

![Capture from VS Code, terminal window. Notification that updating hubs file (hcce) is done. Text includes items like "deployment.apps/dialog created" and "service/lb created".](img/beginnersguide/image84.png)

b. **Copy and paste** this into the terminal and hit **enter** on your keyboard:

```shell
kubectl get deployment -n hcce
```

![Capture from VS Code, terminal window. Text "kubectl get deployment -n hcce" entered. Result is a table of items with their READY, UP-TO-DATE, AVAILABLE, and AGE statuses. ](img/beginnersguide/image85.png)

> üí° Tip: It will take time for everything to be up and running, typically around 70-90 seconds.

**Ensure that everything shows the value of  1 for READY and UP-TO-DATE.**

* If you do have all 1s, go to step f.
* In case you do NOT have all 1s, follow steps c, d, and e below.


c. If you do NOT have all 1s, delete the deployment by **copying and pasting this into the terminal and hit enter** on your keyboard.

```shell
kubectl delete deployment --all --namespace=hcce
```

d. Redeploy by **copying and pasting this into the terminal and hit enter** on your keyboard. (This is a repeat of Step 14a: you have deleted your prior data and you are re-applying or re-uploading it again.)

```shell
kubectl apply -f hcce.yaml
```

e. Copy and paste this into the terminal and hit enter on your keyboard. (This is a repeat of Step 14b: You are re-checking that all of the Hubs pieces are ready to go)

```shell
kubectl get deployment -n hcce
```

It will take time for everything to be up and running, typically around 70-90 seconds.

**Ensure that everything shows the value of  1 for READY and UP-TO-DATE.**

> üí° Tip: Further errors? See our [FAQs](./faq.md) or ask for help in Discord.

f. After your Kubernetes server is up, it will take a few more minutes for DO to set up your load balancer. (In our testing, it was quick; we continued with these steps.) Then, you need to point your domains to the IP address of the load balancer.

**Copy and paste** this into the terminal and **hit enter**:

```shell
kubectl -n hcce get svc lb
```

![Capture from VS Code, terminal window. Text "kubectl -n hcce get svc lb" entered. Resulting "EXTERNAL-IP" is highlighted with text "Copy and save".](img/beginnersguide/image86.png)

g. For EXTERNAL-IP, **copy and save** the number string Terminal window

h. ‚òëÔ∏è [Extra instructions to check that your SMTP email is working](./faq.html#checking-that-my-smtp-is-reachable-from-my-kubernetes-cluster).


> ü§î Advice: Never share your config file with anyone.

Congratulations!! If you have got your external IP, you have your Hubs running on a DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster. Next, we will work on accessing it!

### 14. Add new A records

This step will be very similar to Step 6, Part 3. You will add 4 more new A records. You will copy from your terminal and paste into Porkbun.

a. Log in to [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/).

b. Select **Account**, select **Domain Management**.

![Capture from Porkbun, Account menu. "Domain Management" highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image87.png)

c. Select **Details**, select **DNS Records**.

![Capture from Porkbun. For DNS Records, upward facing arrow highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image88.png)

d. Back in Step 6, we asked you to delete any records with the text pixie in them that appear by default. If you didn‚Äôt do that OR the pixie records have re-appeared, **delete any existing A records** that you didn‚Äôt create. You will create additional new A records in this step.

![Capture from Porkbun. For DNS Records, upward facing arrow highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image89.png)

e. You are adding 4 new ‚ÄòA records‚Äô using that EXTERNAL-IP that you saved; one each for these 4 types
* @
* assets
* cors
* stream

f. For Type: Select **A - Address record**

g. For Host: enter one of each of the A record types: @, assets, cors, or stream

* Note: in our testing, we found that Porkbun deletes the ‚Äú@‚Äù as Host after we clicked Add. Do not be dismayed. We think it‚Äôs fine.

h. Answer: **paste the external IP** that you saved from Step 13, g.

i. Notes: Optional

j. **Select Add.**
* Example of cors:

![Capture from Porkbun, Manage DNS Records page. For "Host" field, "cors" is entered as an example. For "Answer" , the EXTERNAL-IP (blurred) is pasted here.  "Add" button in lower right is highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image90.png)

* Results:

![Capture from Porkbun, DNS Records. Results after entering 4 new records shown highlighted (blurred) in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image91.png)

k. Check that your SSL certificates are missing. At this point, they should be. **Go to your Hubs domain address** (the full website address you purchased in Step 4). You should receive a warning that says something like Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead.  This is normal.

![Capture from Firefox browser. Text: Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead. Choices are "Go Back (Recommended)" in blue or "Advanced" in gray.](img/beginnersguide/image92.png)

l. If you go ahead to the site by selecting **Advanced‚Ä¶** (in this Firefox example), the word admin will be in the address bar and the screen will be blank (or white)

![Capture from Firefox after selecting "advanced". Screen is empty of text. This is normal at this stage.](img/beginnersguide/image93.png)

In the next Step, you‚Äôll generate the proper security certificates.

### 15. Generate certificates

These steps add SSL certificates to your domain so that your admin log-in adds security certificates to the domain and thus everyone else will not receive security warnings.

> ü§î Note: Your SSL certificates expire **every 90 days**. Don‚Äôt worry. We‚Äôve [got instructions for you when that happens](./regenerating-ssl-certificates.md).

a. Return to VS Code.

b. **Copy and paste** this into the terminal and hit **enter** on your keyboard:

```shell
npm run gen-ssl
```

> üí° Tip: It will take time for everything to be up and running, it might take ~5 minutes. Dots may appear, this is normal. This capture below shows the end of the generating certificates process.

![Capture from VS code, terminal window. After entering "npm run gen-ssl" resulting text includes "Generating SSL certificate for: assets..." and "Generated SSL certificate for: cors..."](img/beginnersguide/image94.png)

c. In VS Code, select **hcce.yaml**

![Capture from VS Code, community-edition. "hcce.yaml" file highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image95.png)

d. Select **Control + F** on your keyboard and search for this text: **default-ssl-certificate.**

![Capture from VS code, center code panel. After searching on "default-ssl-certificate" line, the line containing that code is highlighted.](img/beginnersguide/image96.png)

e. Enter a # (number sign) at the beginning of the text line, to the left of the dashes. It will be correct if the line turns green; this means the line has been disabled.

![Capture from VS code, center code panel. After searching on "default-ssl-certificate" line, adding a number sign turned the line from orange to green showing that the default certificates are now disabled.](img/beginnersguide/image97.png)

f. Select **File, Save**. This will keep all of the changes you just made.

![Capture from VS Code, File menu. "File" and "Save" highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image79.png)

g. Now we need to apply your changes to Kubernetes on DO. **Copy and paste** this into the terminal and **hit enter on your keyboard** (this is similar to Step 13, d.)

```shell
kubectl apply -f hcce.yaml
```

h. After it's complete, your instance is running successfully. **Go to your Hubs domain address** (the full website address you purchased in Step 4).  You should not see the Warning that you saw in Step 14, k.  **Enter your admin email**. Select **Next**.

![Capture from Firefox browser. Prompt to "Please sign in" with your  email and "Next" green button highlighted with purple.](img/beginnersguide/image99.png)

i. Check your email inbox. You should receive the magic link email. Select **the magic link**. Go back to **your Hubs domain address**. It should look like this:

![Capture from Firefox browser showing user logged in as Admin to their Hubs domain main page.](img/beginnersguide/image100.png)

j. You should be able to now test your Hubs. Select **Create Room**. At this point your room may just be a dark horizon but it works!

![Capture from Chromium browser. Default hubs space is gray with a dark horizon and box avatars. This is a working Hubs instance!](img/beginnersguide/image101.png)

## **Section 4 Kick the tires and light the fires**

### 16. Create Firewall

Now you have to whitelist a few ports so that the voice chat and screen share/video share work properly.

a. At DigitalOcean, select **Networking**.

![Capture from DigitalOcean, MANAGE menu. "Networking" highlighted with purple.](img/beginnersguide/image102.png)

b.  At Networking, select the **Firewalls** tab.

![Capture from DigitalOcean, Networking page. "Firewalls" tab highlighted with purple.](img/beginnersguide/image103.png)
c. Do not be concerned if you see a Firewall already there. That is the default created by DO. Select **Create Firewall**.

![Capture from DigitalOcean, Networking page. "Create Firewall" blue button highlighted with purple.](img/beginnersguide/image104.png)

d. At Create Firewall, Name, enter **a firewall name** (no dashes allowed in the name).
> ü§î Advice: We used FirstFirewall.

![Capture from DigitalOcean, Networking, Create Firewall page.  Under Name field, "FirstFirewall" (example) highlighted with purple.](img/beginnersguide/image105.png)

e. For Inbound Rules, delete the SSH rule that comes predefined by selecting **Delete**.

![Capture from DigitalOcean, Networking, Create Firewall page. For Inbound Rules, SSH, TCP, 22, "Delete" highlighted with purple.](img/beginnersguide/image106.png)

f. Create three (3) new Inbound Rules. These will whitelist these ports for Hubs to use them.

i. First rule
1. For Type, select **Custom**.
2. For Protocol: select **TCP**
3. For Port Range: enter **4443**
4. For Sources: leave as default (All IPv4 and AllIPv6)
5. Select **New rule** to start the next entry.

ii. Second rule
1. For Type, select **Custom**.
2. For Protocol: select **TCP**
3. For Port Range: enter **5349**
4. For Sources: leave as default (All IPv4 and AllIPv6)
5. Select **New rule** to start the next entry.

iii. Third rule
1. For Type, select **Custom**.
2. For Protocol: select **UDP**
3. For Port Range: enter **35000-60000**
4. For Sources: leave as default (All IPv4 and AllIPv6)

![Capture from DigitalOcean, Networking, Create Firewall page. For Inbound Rules, values entered for TCP Port 4443, TCP Port 5329, and UDP Ports 35000-60000.](img/beginnersguide/image107.png)

g. At Apply to Droplets, **type in the name you entered at Step 5,e.** Hint: it probably starts with hcce.

![Capture from DigitalOcean, Networking, Create Firewall page. Apply to Droplets field. "h" entered as an example and highlighted with purple.](img/beginnersguide/image108.png)

> ü§î  Advice: we typed h and waited. Your one droplet should appear in the drop down box.

![Capture from DigitalOcean, Networking, Create Firewall page. Apply to Droplets field. "hcce-cluster...." highlighted in purple.](img/beginnersguide/image109.png)

**Note**: If you have added tags to your cluster, just use that one tag. It's enough for all the nodes and node groups.

h. Select **Create Firewall.**  There will be a notification that the ‚ÄòFirewall created successfully‚Äô.

i. You may log out of Scaleway, Porkbun, and DigitalOcean. You may close VS Code.
