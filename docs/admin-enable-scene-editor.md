Hubs Cloud includes an unbranded version of [Spoke](http://hubs.local:3000/docs/spoke-creating-projects.html) called the **Scene Editor** can you can use to create custom 3D scenes.

Out of the box, it is disabled for non-administrators. If you want your users to be able to create and edit custom scenes when using your hub, you can enable the Scene Editor for all users.

To do so, open the [Admin Console](./admin-getting-started) then choose **App Settings**:

Then, under **Features**, enable the **Enable Scene Editor** option and click **Save**.
