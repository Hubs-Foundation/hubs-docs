1. Go to Porkbun.com.

2. Under Products, select Domains.

3. Search for a domain name if you already have a specific name in mind or you may shop by reviewing for different ending web domain extensions (the .com or .net or .xyz part of a web address) and their prices.

    Select column headers “Registration”, “Renewal”, or “Transfer” to sort by lowest price in each column.

    For example, let’s say you select the .space (dot space) extension because it is currently on a 1st Year Sale of US$1.11. 🤔 Advice: Pay special attention to the Renewal column, however, because that is what you will be charged every year after.
    Next, search if your full domain name is available to buy. Let’s say you want “mycoolhubs.space”, enter mycoolhubs in the search box and select the magnifying glass (submit search).  
    Note from the future: Scaleway ONLY wants domains that meet these conditions, so follow them now: The domain can only contain alphanumeric characters, dots, and dashes.

4. When you have chosen your full web domain address, select the plus sign under sort by price to add it to your shopping cart.

5. Select Checkout.

6. At Your Cart, select Continue Create account / Login.

7. Under Create a New Account, type in your information to these required fields:
Username, Password, Primary email address, First or Given Name, Address, Country, City, Zip / Postal, Phone Code, Phone Number

    Select the checkbox for “You must agree to the following by checking the checkbox before continuing.
You may say yes or no to awesome emails.”

    Save your username and password somewhere.
Select Create Account.

8. Complete your purchase. Complete the email verification step. Enter your verification code into the pop-up and then select Submit.

> 🤔 Advice: Activate two-factor authentication (2FA) for your account.
