# Development Basics

The Hubs client is a web application that runs in each user&rsquo;s web
browser. It contains the HTML, CSS, and Javascript necessary to simulate a
networked 3D world and display interactive 2D menus. This document provides
an overview of the Hubs client: the technologies it uses, the backend services
it connects to, and how its code is organized.

## Technologies and Backend Services

The client combines several libraries and technologies to provide this
experience to users, and offers developers various ways to change and extend
its functionality.

These are the main technologies in use by the hubs client:

- [`Three.js`](https://threejs.org/) : `Three.js` is a 3D graphics and scene
  graph library for building and creating 3D scenes. Three.js makes it easier
  to use the browser&rsquo;s built-in graphics capabilities, such as
  [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API),
  [WebXR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API),
  and [WebGPU](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API)
  (someday).
- [`bitECS`](https://github.com/NateTheGreatt/bitECS) : `bitECS` is an ECS
  library for managing game state that lives outside the `Three.js` scene graph.
  In the Hubs client, most &ldquo;things&rdquo; (avatars, images, an animated
  emoji) are referenced by an entity ID. This entity ID is used to access
  component data stored in pre-allocated `TypedArrays`.
- [`Media Capture and Streams API`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Capture_and_Streams_API),
  [`WebRTC`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API),
  and [`WebAudio`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) :
  The `Media Capture and Streams API` allows microphones, cameras, and
  screencapture to be accessed within the browser. Data is captured and encoded
  locally before being sent (as `WebRTC` streams) to a backend service
  ([`Dialog`](https://github.com/mozilla/dialog)), where they are forwarded to
  other clients connected to the same room. Incoming streams are decoded and
  transformed (e.g. by `PannerNode` s and `GainNodes` from the `WebAudio` API)
  before being played through the user&rsquo;s speakers.
- [`HTTP`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP),
  [`Web Sockets`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) :
  The Hubs client is web app, which means its code is downloaded when you visit a
  hubs-powered site. After its initial load, the hubs client exchanges many, many
  messages to the backend web server, [`Reticulum`](https://github.com/mozilla/reticulum).
  To download assets like 3D model files and 2D images, the client makes `HTTP`
  requests. To exchange game state information like, &ldquo;where my avatar is
  moving&rdquo;, the client sends messages over a `Web Socket` connection
  (specifically, via [`Phoenix channels`](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)).
- [`Webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/) and [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) :
  The Hubs client is built and bundled by `Webpack`. Building the client (or
  custom versions of the client) typically involves running a few commands with
  `npm`.
- [`Typescript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) : `Typescript` is a superset
  of Javascript that compiles to Javascript. We adopted typescript in 2022. While
  we are not trying to rewrite all of our existing javascript, new code is
  usually written in typescript.

## How the code is organized

There are three main sections of application code:

The [`admin`](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs/tree/master/admin) directory
contains a separate application that powers the Hubs admin panel. Note that
this directory will likely undergo changes in the near future.

The [`react-components`](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs/tree/master/src/react-components)
directory contains all of the 2D UI shown in menus, modals, and toolbars
throughout the client. It is built with [`React`](https://react.dev/).

The [`src`](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs/tree/master/src) directory contains
of the code that powers the 3D simulation. The entry points for various pages
are defined in `webpack.config.js`.
