# Create and Join Rooms

## Create a New Room

To create your own room, head to [Mozilla's Demo Hub](https://hubs.mozilla.com/demo) and click "Create a Room". Your new space is private; no one else can join until you invite them.

## Join an Existing Room

You can join an existing Hubs room using either a URL or a numeric code. If you have a URL, navigate to the URL in your browser. If you have a numeric code, visit [hubs.link](https://hubs.link) to use it.

## Enter a Room

Before entering a Hubs room you are in the room's lobby. You can see and hear what's going on in the room but you can only interact with the others using text chat. The process of entering a room is a bit different depending on your device.

### On Desktop / Mobile

Click "Enter Room" and follow the prompts to select a username/avatar and set up your mic. On the final prompt select "Enter on Screen", or "Enter on Phone" if on mobile.

### On a Standalone VR Headset

If you opened the URL on your desktop or smartphone, choose "Enter on Standalone VR" to create a code that makes it easy to open on your standalone headset (e.g., Oculus Quest, Oculus Go, Samsung Gear).

Open the browser in your VR headset, navigate to [hubs.link](https://hubs.link) and enter the code.

### On a Wired-in VR Headset

We recommend [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) for wired-in headsets (e.g., Oculus Rift, Windows Mixed Reality, Vive). To use a desktop VR device with your headset, the Oculus app (Oculus Rift) or SteamVR (Windows Mixed Reality, Vive) must also be open.

On your computer, click "Enter Room" and follow the prompts to select a username/avatar and set up your mic. On the final prompt before entering you should see an option to select "Connected VR Headset".

For troubleshooting information visit Hubs [troubleshooting](./hubs-troubleshooting.html) page.

## Supported Devices & Browsers

Since Hubs runs in the browser, it works across many different platforms.

### For 2D Experience

Hubs works on most modern desktop browsers on Windows, Mac and Linux. It also works on most mobile browsers for Android, and Safari on iOS.

Currently, Hubs is supported on the following browsers:  
| Platform | Browsers |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Windows | Firefox, Chrome, Edge (version 79+) |
| Mac OS | Firefox, Chrome, Safari |
| Linux | Firefox |
| Android | Firefox, Chrome |
| iOS | Safari |

### For VR Experience

For Desktop VR (Oculus Rift, Windows Mixed Reality, or Vive) Hubs works when used with a WebVR compatible browser (e.g., Firefox). Users must also have either the Oculus app (Oculus Rift), or SteamVR installed (Windows Mixed Reality, Vive).

For Standalone VR devices (Pico Neo 2, Oculus Quest and Oculus Go) Hubs works in the Mozilla Firefox Reality Browser or the Oculus Browser.

Mobile phone powered VR systems, such as Samsung Gear and Google Cardboard, work using Google Chrome browser.

Note that some features may be limited on low-powered devices such as mobile phones.
