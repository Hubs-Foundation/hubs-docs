**Follow along:** [Video Tutorial: How to Deploy Hubs Cloud Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K7P8jFyHNc)

1. Create an account on AWS and log into the console.
2. Register or setup any domains in AWS Route 53, you'll need at least 2 domains. For example: `myhub.com` and `myhub.link`. See [Domain Recipes](./hubs-cloud-aws-domain-recipes.md) for more info.
3. Review relevant docs:
   - [Why use Hubs Cloud vs. hubs.mozilla.com?](./hubs-cloud-faq.md#why-use-hubs-cloud-vs-hubsmozillacom)
   - [Personal vs. Enterprise](./hubs-cloud-faq.md#personal-vs-enterprise)
   - [Cost Information](./hubs-cloud-aws-costs.md)
4. Create an SSH keypair to access your servers
   - [Follow AWS guide to create the SSH keypair in your deployment region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair)
   - Deployment region is in the upper right corner with your username and support
   - Save the private key using preferred format
