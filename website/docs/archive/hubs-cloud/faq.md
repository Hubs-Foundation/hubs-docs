# FAQ

## Why use Hubs Cloud vs. hubs.mozilla.com?

**Hubs Cloud allows you all the functionality of hubs.mozilla.com and also comes with additional features to customize branding, the url, user accounts, the interface and code inside the hubs client.** You're in control of your Hubs Cloud instance and its data via AWS or DigitalOcean infrastructure, Mozilla simply provides the template and automatic updates. This makes it perfect for creating a totally bespoke Hubs experience.

The max room size is the same as hubs.mozilla.com: 25 avatars per room + 75 to the lobby ([More on room capacity here](./hubs-faq.md#what-is-the-capacity-of-a-hubs-room)).

Try out Hubs via hubs.mozilla.com and when you're familiar and interested in using it for big events, exclusive personal meetups, or for a business, check out [Hubs Cloud](./hubs-cloud-intro.md).

Documentation for customizing your Hubs Cloud instance:

- [Branding + look and feel](./hubs-cloud-customizing-look-and-feel.md)
- [Customizing hub url](./hubs-cloud-aws-domain-recipes.md)
- Managing accounts via the Admin Panel - _documentation coming soon_
- [Customizing the user interface and client code](./hubs-cloud-custom-clients.md)

## Personal vs. Enterprise?

- Personal defaults are lower cost. Enterprise defaults are higher cost but improve site functionality like no database pausing.
- The main difference: Enterprise allows multiple servers. If one goes down unexpectantly, the others will take over. Personal allows only one server.
- Beyond that, they are the same in the options they offer and cost per server is the same. Personal can be configured to be an expensive, highly scalable single server, and vice versa.
