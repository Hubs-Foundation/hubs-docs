# Discord Bot (Deprecated)

## About

The [Hubs Discord Bot](https://hubs.mozilla.com/discord) makes it easy to connect Hubs rooms to your Discord chat server. When a Hubs room is associated with a Discord channel, users will be assigned abilities in the Hubs room based on their Discord roles. For example, Discord owners and moderators will be able to change settings on a Hubs room and be able to moderate users in the room.

## Set Up

If your room is hosted on hubs.mozilla.com:

1. [Click here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=509129921826914304&permissions=536890368&scope=bot) to invite the Hubs Discord bot to your Discord server.
2. Choose the channel(s) you want Hubs to run in or create new one(s).
3. Give the bot appropriate permissions (see below) on these channels.
4. Create a webhook named "Hubs" in the channels you want it to run in. (Go to the channel's Settings-->Integrations) It will use this
   webhook to bridge chat and send Hubs status updates.
5. Try out the bot! Type !hubs in a channel the bot is in to see some things you can do.

Using Hubs Cloud? You can [add the bot to your Hubs Cloud server](./hubs-cloud-discord-bot.md).

### User Permissions

Your room's user permissions will inherit the permissions that their Discord role has in the channel that the bot is bound to. Specifically

- To enter the room they must have "View Channel" permission
- To be a moderator they must have "Kick Members" permission (and "View Channel").
  - Moderators can kick and mute members in the hubs room.
  - Moderators can also create and manipulate objects, draw and share video even if these are turned off in the room settings.
  - Note: only discord users with verified emails can become moderators
- To be a room owner they must have "Manage Channels" (and "Kick Members and "View Channel")
  - Room owners are able to change the name and scene in the room, modify other room settings, and close the room.
  - Note: only discord users with verified emails can become room owners
- The discord permissions can set either via their discord role globally, or permissions given on the specific channel to that user/role

### Bot Permissions

The bot requires several permissions in order to work.

- "Send messages," "Read messages," and "Embed links" are necessary in order to bridge between the Hubs room that is linked to a channel and the messages that are sent within the channel on Discord.
- "Manage webhooks" is necessary in order for the bot to find and use a webhook for bridging chat.
- "Manage channels" is necessary in order for the bot to set the channel topic and bridge chat. Note: We do not ask for this permission globally when you add the bot to your server, instead we recommend you grant this permission to the bot in specific groups or channels.

### Commands

The following features outline the current bot commands and how they can be accessed by users in the Discord server:

ðŸ¦†`!hubs` - Lists information about the currently linked room.

ðŸ¦†`!hubs create` - Creates a default Hubs room and puts its URL into the channel topic. Rooms created with `!hubs create` will inherit moderation permissions from this Discord channel and only allow Discord users in this channel to join the room.
